### 💭 Chapter 21: Mixed Signals

Chapter 21 opens with lingering tension from previous encounters. The lead characters — still unsure about where they stand — find themselves dancing between closeness and distance.

#### 🌸 Highlights:

* **Emotional Push-Pull**: One moment they're sharing a laugh, the next there's silence. This chapter explores the uncertainty of new feelings and fear of rejection.
* **A Soft Moment**: A small but meaningful gesture changes the tone — maybe a hand touch, or a lingering glance. It feels honest and unforced.
* **Inner Conflict**: Both characters are thinking deeply, but not speaking much. The art speaks louder than the dialogue in this chapter.

#### 🌟 Highlights:

* **A Private Conversation**: One of the leads finally speaks their mind. It’s not dramatic — just honest.
* **Blushing and Smiles**: Subtle reactions show their growing comfort with each other.
* **Unspoken Affection**: It's the little things — how they look at each other, how they don’t want the moment to end.
